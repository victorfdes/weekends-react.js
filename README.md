## How many weekends do you have?

This one project was something I was inspired to build after watching the [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator) by Tim Urban. At the end of the talk he shows us a chart that he calls the Life Calendar. That really got me thinking about how few weekends do we all have. We all tend to live our life in weeks and it sort of feels okay to delay that weekend trip with family or that party you always wanted to have at your place to the next week since well, we sort of have an unlimited weekend supply isnâ€™t it? Well it turns out our weekends are quite limited and definitely countable.
